        I do not know where this story goes.
        Surprised how it started.
        I do not know what tomorrow looks like.
        <br><br>
        But I do know is that
        <br><br>
        Loving you has been one of the easiest,
        most genuine feelings I have ever had.
        Proud to say you do not remind me of anyone
        every experience with you is unique ,Ilysm.
        <br><br>
        This isn’t a promise of forever.
        It is just me choosing you,
        right here, right now.
